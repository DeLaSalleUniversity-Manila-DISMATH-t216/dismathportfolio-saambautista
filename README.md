#Superman Assignment:
<UL>
<LI> a: superman is able to prevent evil
<LI> w: superman is willing to prevent evil
<LI> p: superman prevents evil
<LI> i: superman is impotent
<LI> m: superman is malevolent
<LI> e: superman exists
<LI> Premises and Conclusion
<LI> Premise 1: (a ^ w) → p
<LI> Premise 2: ¬a → i
<LI> Premise 3: ¬w → m
<LI> Premise 4: ¬p
<LI> Premise 5: e → (¬i ^ ¬m)
<LI> Conclusion: P1 ^ P2 ^ P3 ^ P4 ^ P5 → ¬e
<LI> By contraposition of Premise 5, not e is valid which concludes that superman does not exist:
<LI> P5: e → (¬i ^¬m) by contraposition
<LI> ¬(¬i ^ ¬m) → ¬e - De morgan's
<LI> (i & m) → ¬e
<LI> Solution:
<LI> a. Premise 1 by contraposition: ¬p → ¬(a ^ w)
<LI> b. By Modus Ponens Premise 4 and 1: ¬(a ^ w) - De Morgan's
<LI> c. ¬a & ¬w
<LI> d. Premise 2 transformed using A → B = ¬A & B: ¬¬a & i
<LI> e. Premise 3 transformed using A → B = ¬A & B: ¬¬w & m
<LI> f. Premise 2  & 3 combined using addition & associative with commutative properties: f1. ¬¬a & (i & m) f2. ¬¬w & (i & m)
<LI> g. f1. and f2. are transformed using A -> B = ¬A & B: 1. ¬a → (i & m) 2. ¬w -> (i & m)
<LI> h. By Disjunctive Elimination on c. f1. and f2.: (i & m)
<LI> i. By contraposition on Premise 5: (i & m) -> ¬e
<LI> j. By Modus Ponens on h. and i.: ¬e 
<LI> THEREFORE, SUPERMAN DOES NOT EXIST.

#Week 1-3 
<UL>
<LI> Absent due to hospitalization
</UL>

#Week 4
<UL>
<LI> Vacuous and Trivial Proof were explained.
<LI> Method of Proof by Contradiction was discussed together with different examples.
<LI> Induction and Recursion were introduced to the class and an example was given.
<LI> There will always be a basis step before proceeding to the main process such as the inductive or recursive step.
<LI> The basis step is the assumption process while the inductive or recursive step is the step were the statement is proved.
